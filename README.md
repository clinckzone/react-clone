# react-clone

Didact is a react clone which aims to demonstrate the concepts that react is based on. It is based on the tutorial from [Rodrigo Pombo](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) called **Build your own React**.

Starting from scratch, these are all the things we have added to our version of React:  
**I:** The createElement Function  
**II:** The render Function  
**III:** Concurrent Mode  
**IV:** Fibers  
**V:** Render and Commit Phases  
**VI:** Reconciliation  
**VII:** Function Components  
**VIII:** Hooks
